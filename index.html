  Hi, my name is Jean Bahnik. I am a software engineer at Trunk Club. I live in Chicago and this is my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.<br/><br/>
  I build web applications. I usually use Ruby (Rails/Sinatra) for back end and Backbone for front end. I store data with PostgreSQL; I will also use MongoDB, MySQL or Redis, depending on the needs of the project.
