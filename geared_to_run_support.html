    <h3>The app stays stuck on the loading screen</h3>

    The spinner keeps spinning but never gets to the weather and recommendation page. That's because the source Geared to Run relies on for weather information has become temporarily unresponsive. We recommend you close the app and try again later.<br/>

    <h3>The app crashes when loading a page or a screen</h3>

    “Multi-tasking” has been supported on the iPhone and iPad since the release of iOS 4. Apps can remain active in the background, even if the user is already working with a different app. Unfortunately, these “background apps” are always taking up part of the limited central memory. Occasionally this can result in apps crashing on heavily used devices with several apps running in the background and with several Safari tabs open. In most cases it helps to completely restart the device:
    To do so, press and hold the Lock button on the upper right-hand side of your device until you are prompted to turn off the device. Turn off the device completely, then turn it back on.
