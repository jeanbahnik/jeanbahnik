  Hi, my name is Jean Bahnik. I'm currently an engineering manager at <a href="http://www.trunkclub.com/engineering">Trunk Club</a>, where I manage the Member team (iOS, Android, web apps for customers, and the web services that support them). I support my team through coding, planning, recruiting, coaching and mentoring. When coding, I help with backend (Ruby) and iOS (some Obj-C, mostly Swift). I'm passionate about building great teams and awesome products.
  <br/><br/>
  In past lives, I worked in marketing and management and also founded a company in France. You can get my <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/resumes/JeanBahnikResume12-10-15.pdf">resume here (pdf)</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  Feel free to connect with me if you want to chat, have an interesting challenge or opportunity, or think I can help you in any way.<br/><br/>
  I live in Chicago with my beautiful family. When I'm not programming, I <a href="/running">run</a> and take <a href="http://500px.com/jeanbahnik">photos</a>.
