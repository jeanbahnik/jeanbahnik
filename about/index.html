  Hi, my name is Jean Bahnik. I am building iOS applications at <a href="http://www.trunkclub.com/engineering">Trunk Club</a>. I live in Chicago with my beautiful family.<br/><br/>
  I also do back end, usually with Ruby (Rails/Sinatra). I sometimes use Backbone for front end. I store data with PostgreSQL; I will also use MongoDB, MySQL or Redis, depending on the needs of the project.<br/><br/>
  When I'm not programming, I <a href="races.html">run</a> and take <a href="http://500px.com/jeanbahnik">photos</a>.

Currently an engineering manager at Trunk Club, where I manage the Member team (iOS, Android, Web apps for customers, and the web services that supports them).
I support my team through coding, planning, recruiting, coaching and mentoring. I'm passionate about building great teams and products. When coding, I can help with backend (Ruby) and iOS (some Obj-C, mostly Swift).

In a previous life I was in marketing and management. And I started a company in France before that.
<!-- OR: -->
Before that, I was programmning in college, got into marketing after college, started a company in France, did more marketing after that, moved into management, before I learned to properly code.
