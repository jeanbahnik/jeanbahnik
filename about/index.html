  Hi, my name is Jean Bahnik. I am building iOS applications at <a href="http://www.trunkclub.com/engineering">Trunk Club</a>. I live in Chicago with my beautiful family.<br/><br/>
  I also do back end, usually with Ruby (Rails/Sinatra). I sometimes use Backbone for front end. I store data with PostgreSQL; I will also use MongoDB, MySQL or Redis, depending on the needs of the project.<br/><br/>
  When I'm not programming, I <a href="races.html">run</a> and take <a href="http://500px.com/jeanbahnik">photos</a>.

I am an engineering manager at Trunk Club, where I am able to grow my knowledge and passion for building applications in a thriving agile environment. After 10 years in marketing and management, I changed careers in 2011, becoming a software developer. I have worked mostly with Ruby (Rails and Sinatra) since October 2011. In 2013, I added Objective-C, then Swift in 2014, to my skill set.

Help my team:
Do whatever it takes to unblock
Code
Hire
Grow people
Keep them connected to the business
Keep them motivated, interested

My philosophies

What I'm looking for, what I want to do next, who do I want to connect with.

Journey at TC (Apprentice -> Backend Engineer -> iOS Engineer -> Engineering Manager)
Journey before TC (programmning in college, marketing after college, CF programming, marketing, started my own thing, more marketing, management, learned to code)
