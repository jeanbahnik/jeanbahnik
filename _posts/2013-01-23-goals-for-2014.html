I have been drafting this post for most of January. It started off way more ambitious that it is now. It included four new programming languages, four! And projects, lots of them. And some behavioral changes. I'm surprised fixing all things or world peace was not in there. But I'm glad that I spent these last few weeks thinking about it. And being crunched with time. It forced me to think about what was essential, and put the rest in the nice-to-have/there's-also-next-year-and-the-one-after categories.

There are also a few good articles that influenced me:


Here it is, personal goals for this year:

Tie learning to a concrete project. Postpone what is just pure learning for now.

An iPhone app:
I started learning Objective-C in December, and my goal is to publish an app to the app store this year.

Building up on a simple API app to support my iPhone app, port them to:
(Learn Go)
Learn Python
(Learn Clojure)

(Set up and release to EC2, Heroku. Using Heroku for now, migrate to EC2/RDS)

(Maybe: Memcached, MySQL, Cassandra, App Engine, Messaging, Elastic Search)

(Build an app with Middleman. Learned to use Jekyll last year for this blog, read some interesting selling points about middleman
)
(Build an app with Angular)

And focus on one thing at a time. All the free time "gained" from limiting this year's goals list should go into family, health and blogging.

It's still more aggressive than last years' goals (<a href="/2012/12/15/learning-a-new-language-this-year-javascript.html">Learning a new language this year: javascript</a>)

Keep me accountable, ask me how I'm doing. I'll update this blog post with progress.
