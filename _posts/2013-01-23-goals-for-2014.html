I have been drafting this post for most of January. It started off way more ambitious that what it is now that I'm publishing it. It included four new programming languages, four! And personal projects, lots of them. And some personal changes (I'm surprised fixing all things and world peace was not in there). I'm glad that I spent these last few weeks thinking about it. And being crunched with time. It forced me to think about what was essential, and put the rest in the nice-to-have/there's-also-next-year-and-the-year-after categories.

Then on January 27th I officially changed roles at Trunk Club and joined the mobile team. I'm super excited to learn Objective-C and to start building iOS apps. But it also made me reduce the length of that list further.

So here it is, my personal goals for this year 2004:

Build and release an iPhone app:
I started learning Objective-C in December, and so my main goal is to publish an app in the app store this year.

Sinatra (or Grape or Rails) app to support the iPhone app.

Release on Heroku, later this year Set up and migrate to EC2/RDS.

Build an website with Middleman. I switched to Jekyll last year for this blog and I'm curious to build the website to market the iPhone app using Middleman as it seems to have a lot of niceties.

Any learning this year will be tied to a concrete project, the iOS app. I'll postpone what is just pure learning.

Speak once at a conference.

And focus on one thing at a time. All the free time "gained" from limiting this year's goals list should go mostly into family, and then more exercising and blogging.

It's still more aggressive than last years' goals (<a href="/2012/12/15/learning-a-new-language-this-year-javascript.html">Learning a new language this year: javascript</a>)

Just for fun, here is the list of nice-tos that I will put aside for now: learn Go, learn Python, learn Clojure, Memcached, MySQL, Cassandra, App Engine, Messaging, Elastic Search, Angular

Keep me accountable, ask me how I'm doing. I plan on updating this blog post with progress.
