10/29/11, Chicago, IL: 1:39:18 (7:35 pace)

I’m so excited about these results. I’ve been training for 3 months for this, working on besting my time from the 2009 NY Half (1:44:22), using Ryan Halls Training Program (from Runner’s World) with a goal pace of 7:50/mile. I ended up running it 15 seconds faster per mile!

The weather was good, in the low 40s at the start. I dropped the running jacket around mile 3 (thanks Erika!), the gloves and hat around mile 9. It was sunny and very little wind.

I kept a below 7:30 pace for most of the race, slowing down around mile 9. I did find some energy racing through the last 1/4 mile, although I literally had no idea what my legs were doing at that point (or how they did it). As I was approaching the finish line I saw the counter approaching 1:40:00, which probably help push me. I forgot that I started a little after the gun and was initially disappointed to cross the line after 1:40:00. But still happy to beat my PR.

The race organization could have been a bit better: no bag given at packet pickup; race started 11 minutes late; sometimes had to run through grass because the road was blocked. But the jacket is very nice, the course got me running in front of my house around mile 3 and then mile 10 seeing Erika and Christian twice, and most of the course was on my very familiar path along the lake. Being able to walk from the house to the start and back was a nice plus.

And I beat my PR!

Now I have to think about my next race, probably another half marathon. Somewhere sunny in April/May when we’ll still be in the snow in Chicago :-)
