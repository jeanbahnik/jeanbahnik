Since joining the Trunk Club Engineering team in February 2011, I've traversed the design and engineering gamut ranging from product discovery / design to application development. Though business needs required my role to be a bit of a generalist at times, my focus for most projects is on product / interface design and UI engineering for web and iOS applications. These projects span a period ranging from a small tech team within a sole Chicago headquarters to working with dozens of world class engineers for [offices across the nation][link3] (not to mention [being acquired][link2]).

_Note: For some examples throughout this post sensitive business information has been removed_

_All of these experiences were the product of a team and reflect the state they were at during my active design/development. At Trunk Club we have a very iterative / test driven approach and each of these has been continually developed upon since._

### Stylist iOS App

Related to this area of work is an iOS app a small team and I designed and built from the ground up (our first app in Swift) that allows employees to better manage their members and associated tasks throughout the day / when away from a desk. The app acts as a companion to the desktop software and was designed in the context of being on-the-go. The app gives employees the ability to review relevant member information, create new members, review and complete tasks, review personal goals, and more.

### Custom iOS App

Another iOS app we were able to take from product vision & design all the way through first release was an iPad app created to standardize and better the experience for the custom garment process. This app and the backend service that supported it provided the first real structured data set related to our custom garment business. The app gave employees the ability to store and edit member measurements and create / edit / duplicate orders. Beyond this it provided several auto-calculated and auto-completed values, as well as warnings when values are outside of an expected threshold.

### Member iOS App

After spending a lot of time on internal tools, I worked on the [Trunk Club iOS App][link4]. Starting with a complete rewrite in Swift (along with a new navigation/info architecture), a small team and I constantly iterated over different tests to produce features that allowed the member to stay more connected to their stylist and allow for more interaction with their wardrobe.
