On Tuesday I started my first week of Code Academy (<a href="http://www.codeacademy.org">http://www.codeacademy.org</a>). And what a great first week it was!
<br/>
Monday we got a surprise visit from <a href="http://twitter.com/dhh">@dhh</a>, David Heinemer-Hanson, co-founder of 37Signals and creator of Ruby on Rails. He spent 30 minutes or so with us answering our questions. It was a great way to start.
<br/>
Tuesday was the first class, where we went trhough some of the basics of Ruby, Rails and HTML. I already knew about that from following Michael Hartl’s classes but it was a great refresher. I also got to met with my mentor for the first time on Tuesday.
<br/>
Finally we had our first accelerated classes on Tuesday and Saturday, where we discussed everyone’s projects and ideas, as well as ways to improve the program.
<br/>
Overall: very happy, very satisfied. A Good first week. But it is also showing me how much more I have to learn and do to get BeeBuzz launched. More on this very soon…
