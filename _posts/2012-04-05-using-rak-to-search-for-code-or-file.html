Today <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fablednet">Sarah Grey</a> introduced me to rak during our pairing session. rak makes it very easy to search for a piece of code in your project, or search for files by their name.

From <a href="http://rak.rubyforge.org/">http://rak.rubyforge.org/</a>:

<em>"Rak is a grep replacement in pure Ruby. It accepts Ruby syntax regular expressions and automatically recurses directories, skipping .svn/, .cvs/, pkg/ and more things you don't care about."</em>

After installing the gem through:
<pre>gem install rak</pre>
just type
<pre>rak search_term</pre>
to find the search_term in your code. There are a lot of options such as [FILES] to search on those files/directories,  -i to ignore the case or --group to group matches by file name. Go check it out at <a href="http://rak.rubyforge.org/">http://rak.rubyforge.org/</a>.

I just used it to find examples of inject. Let me know if it helps you.
