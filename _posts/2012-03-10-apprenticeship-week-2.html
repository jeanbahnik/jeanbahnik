Second week at Trunk Club and I feel like I’m a bit in over my head. In a good way though…
<br/>
I’m learning to work in a team. While we did have hack days and an intro to git/Github during Code Academy, the process in place to work on the same code for a team of many is new to me. I’m strting to use git at the command line a lot more, trying to stay away for as long as possible from Github’s (supposedly great) <a href="http://mac.github.com/">Github for Mac</a>. I'm learning to fetch, pull, add, commit and it feels like I’m just scratching the surface. I set myself reminders in my calendar for regular tasks like git remote prune origin until it just become a habit to do it after a release. Finally, I had to read this interesting article on <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git workflow</a> since this is the process that we’re using. The article is very well written and I highly recommend it.
<br/>
I’ve also been familiarizing myself with our code base: associations, gems, infrastructure. Things are made easier by the fact that we’re following Rails standards. But I still find a lot of new methods that I will have to learn as I go through our models.
<br/>
I’m also spending time talking to various departments to understand their needs, including sales, finance and ops. I’ve spent quite some time with finance, actually doing some of the reconciliation work that they do every day. This gives me a good idea for areas of improvement, tasks that could be simplified or automated with technology.
<br/>
We lost one of our senior guys last week but we’re also talking to a lot of people. Looks like we’re going to get some great people very soon. Exciting!
