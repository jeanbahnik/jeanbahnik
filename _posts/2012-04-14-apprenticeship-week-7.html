This week I have been pairing a lot more. I think I paired with almost every back-end developer that we have. Naturally it reminded me of the 12 weeks of Code Academy. Overall it was very good and I certainly learned a lot. It also helped that everyone I paired with took the time to answer any questions that I had, no matter how trivial or complex.
<br/>
It was also nice to see how each one of them actually worked. Some focus a lot on TDD, while others have a "get things done" approach. It was refreshing to see that no matter what their level was, each one of them made mistakes or sometimes needed help as well.
<br/>
Overall, it reaffirms the decision I made to become a programmer.
<br/>
Regarding the apprenticeship itself, the wiki list of topics is finalized and I updated my previous post about it to reflect the few changes that were made.
<br/>
Finally, this week during our weekly Team Lunch, Corey did a presentation on MongoDB that helped me finally understand what NOSQL databases are about.
<br/>
Previously, I had only worked with MS SQL, mysql and Postgresql and never really knew how to use Mongodb. Now I found a good way to use it next week on my GeckoBoard project for data snapshots. Excited!
