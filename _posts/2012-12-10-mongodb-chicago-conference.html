ADD: photos, links to presentations, comments &amp; final notes.

Why I signed up (offer, program, one day), how much it cost, where is it, more info?

&nbsp;

<strong>9:10</strong> Leaving the office after an early arrival to the office (thanks C)

<strong>9:20</strong> Registered. Got name tag, field notes, nice mongo cheat sheet booklet, invite to after-party and schedule for the day

There's a nice breakfast buffet. I should have thought about that and saved a bowl of Qix...

<strong>9:30</strong> On to the welcome talk, a quick 10 minute overview of MongoDB, 10gen, their progress and the conference.

On may way out I grab a t-shirt, a mug and the necessary stickers to (not) put on my laptop. Weird that they only have size Ss, this is an engineer conference after all.

<strong>10:00</strong> Jenna deBoisblanc again, doing the first talk. Building your first app with MongoDB.

What I'm learning:

The document that Mongo stores is a JSON object.

She's funny, the crowd is asleep though.

to research: full support for primary and secondary indexes, horizontally scalable

I need to get the slides.

Mongo has a shell written in javascript.

Time to empty my cup: comparing with RDBMS

Moving on to apartment app

Insert is simply done with a flexible JSON object

Embending documents is possible by using the _id index.

Querying is also simple once you know the operators. You can also query with regex.

You can use update a schema using the set operator.

paging your results is done in a pretty cool way

Introducing next chats. Need to look for indexing @ 11:40 and replication at 1:55pm to answer Mike's questions.

People are asking about GUI for Mongo. Best option seems to be Mongovue... for Windows.

<strong>10:30</strong> Done.

<strong>10:45</strong> Schema Design with MongoDB by Chad Tindel form 10gen

Why Mongo: faster to access data, saving resources on joins

You need to think about how  you're going to access your data (slide)

Interesting to see how to do relations. Simple and intuitive. He's also showing us what not to do, like having a document that keeps on growing.

Talking about Links: need to look more into it.

Nice conditional updates through findAndModify

<strong>11:10</strong> Questions

<strong>11:20</strong> Done

Snagged a second delicious yogurt parfait.

<strong>11:40</strong> Indexing and Query Optimization by Richard Kreuter

Indexing is the most tunable performance optimization in Mongo

Indexing is simple, can be ordered asc or desc

You can do an index on an array (inverted index), index a nested document, can do compound index on 2 fields.

You can list index (slide)

All indexes (primary and secondary) points to the exact location of documents (and not the location through the primary key)

You can make indexes unique.

There are some limitations (slides)

You can profile slow ops (slide), it has a Query Optimizer that works in an empirical fashion

We ran out of time :-(

<strong>12:25</strong> Done

12:25 Corey!

Did great, photos, link to slides

<strong>1:00</strong> Done, talking to people

<strong>1:20</strong> lunch

<strong>1:45</strong> CoD Black Ops 2!

<strong>2:00</strong> Replication

How to avoid failures, improve lately issues

3 nodes, 2 with data (Primary and Secondary) and an Arbiter node

Great real-life explanation of primary and secondary nodes use

Kinda lost with read preferences

&nbsp;

<strong>2:45</strong> MongoDB for analytics

data freak, great intro story about saving stats while playing NES game

inserts anecdotes about himself in talk, like "never saw Star Wars"

talks about growing and scaling

<strong>3:20</strong> Done. Great talk by @jnunemaker

<strong>3:35</strong> Schema documentation and design using a Mind Map

<strong>4:15</strong> Done

&nbsp;

Questions from Mike:

How does indexing work with Mongo?

How does eventual consistency work?

write to primary, then propagate to secondary, then reads Driver

How do you observe Mongo models?
