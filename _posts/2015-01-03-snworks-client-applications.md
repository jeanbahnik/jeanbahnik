During my time at [SNWorks][link1] I spent my time as a bit of a utility knife, spending most of my time in front-end development / UI design and eventually leading the development team on several client projects (as well as our own [statenews.com][link1]).

My most common projects involved full services for university news outlets; which included integration and feature development on our in-house developed CMS "Gryphon" (a content management system tailored to newsrooms), UI design and development for client sites, and support / training for stakeholders. Client projects I led included:

+ [Otterbein360][link3]
+ [Grand Valley Lanthorn][link4]
+ [The Michigan Times][link5]
+ [Near Duke Housing][link6]
+ [The Daily Gamecock][link7]

All projects touted RWD practices for consumption on the go, with applications ranging from straightforward news outlets to a responsive web app to find student housing:
