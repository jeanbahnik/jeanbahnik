Well that didn’t take long: after <a href="/2011/11/17/textmate-coda-mvim-what-to-choose.html">my post yesterday</a> saying that I was going to use Coda, I’m already switching to Textmate. Just like I thought, Michael Hartl uses Textmate in one of his example. It was for the optional step of setting up an editor for commit messages. I did try to google how to do that with Coda, couldn’t find the answer quickly enough and figured that with everything that I have to learn, it’s better for now not to try to learn how to use another editor than the author’s. Textmate has a <a href="http://macromates.com/">30 day trial</a> available.
