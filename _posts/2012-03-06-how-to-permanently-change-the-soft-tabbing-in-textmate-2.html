So far I've been happy with TextMate 2 but one thing that has been really bothering me: having to change the indent type and size every time I open a Haml file. A lot of blog posts and Stack Overflow response mention the drop-down at the bottom of the window but I was looking for a permanent solution.Â So here is how to fix it once and for all:
<br/><br/>
From the terminal run, assuming TextMate is installed in the Applications folder:
{% highlight shell-session %}
mate ~/../../Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/Default.tmProperties
{% endhighlight %}
Then add the following lines:
{% highlight python %}
[ "*.{haml,yml,coffee,feature}" ] softTabs = true
tabSize = 2
{% endhighlight %}
