So far I've been happy with TextMate 2 but one thing that has been really bothering me: having to change the indent type and size every time I open a Haml file. A lot of blog posts and Stack Overflow response mention the drop-down at the bottom of the window but I was looking for a permanent solution.Â So here is how to fix it once and for all:

From the terminal run, assuming TextMate is installed in the Applications folder:
<pre><code>mate ~/../../Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/Default.tmProperties</code></pre>
Then add the following lines:
<pre><code>[ "*.{haml,yml,coffee,feature}" ] </code>softTabs = true
tabSize = 2</pre>
