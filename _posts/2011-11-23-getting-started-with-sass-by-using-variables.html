I started taking advantage of SASS for uTellmewhen.com to clean up my code. I’m taking baby steps refactoring my code now that I have a better understanding of CSS.
<br/>
For this project, we used Twitter’s Bootstrap framework initially during startup weekend at Code Academy. Then I added Eric Meyer’s reset file, removed the bootstrap file and built the current CSS from scratch.
<br/>
To make my code cleaner I started using SASS’s variables feature today. I am only using 6 colors at this point, including black and white. I should probably move these variables to another file but for now/testing I put these 6 variables at the top of my main CSS file:
<pre>$dark-orange: #f0801b;
$light-orange: #E06506;
$dark-blue: #2a7fb5;
$light-blue: #6388a1;
$black: #000;
$white: #fff;</pre>
I am then referencing these color variables in my CSS like this:
<br/>
background: linear-gradient(top, $dark-orange, $light-orange);<br/>
That’s it. My code is already cleaner and easier to read. It also helped me find a couple of discrepancies (wrong color in certain places) and harmonize my style.
<br/>
I still have a lot to learn about CSS and SASS to take full advantage of it (on my list: nesting and mixins as well as having a responsive design). Let me know what you think in the comments.
