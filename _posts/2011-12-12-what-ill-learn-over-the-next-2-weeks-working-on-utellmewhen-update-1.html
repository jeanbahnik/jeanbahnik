I've completed my database "remodeling". And all the bug fixing that came with it. I also installed the Devise gem and I think I'm 90% through replacing my old, home-grown user authentication system with Devise.

Tomorrow I should tackle OmniAuth as well as some CSS for quick wins.

I also need to update my slides for the demo and practice my improved presentation.
