Instead of beebuzz.herokuapp.com I want to use beebuzz.com as my app’s domain name. Heroku has great instructions for it at <a href="http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains</a>. (By the way, I emailed the author of the screencast, Oren, to ask him about the software he used to record the screencast and got an answer within minutes :-) )
<br/>
The order of the instructions is a bit reversed if, like me, you start from scratch but here it is:
<br/>
In your terminal, for the app you want to modify, enter:
<pre>$ heroku domains:add www.example.com
$ heroku domains:add example.com</pre>
You’re now done with Heroku but need to change your DNS settings. I am not using the Zerigo DNS add-on, I’m simply using the godaddy DNS tool since my domains are hosted there. I removed all the defaults DNS lines from the zone file, leaving only the NS settings.
<br/>
I added a CNAME for www.example.com pointing to example-app.heroku.com, per the Heroku's instructions.
<br/>
Finally I entered the five MX records for Google Apps for my email. Here is the documentation for it: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=174125">http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=174125</a>. It can take time for the changes to propagate but my tests (going to 2 URLs and sending myself an email) were successful minutes after saving my changes.
<br/>
Let me know if you did it differently, if you use Zerigo, and if so, why, or anything else, in the comments below. Thanks!
