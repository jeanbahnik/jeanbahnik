I had the chance to pair with Dave Hoover (<a href="http://twitter.com/redsquirrel">@redsquirrel</a>) last Friday. We worked on new migrations for uTellmewhen, as I decided to remodel my database schema to plan for the future.Â I prepared the new schema in Excel with a few questions. Overall it was pretty straight-forward.
<br/><br/>
Dave is smart and he is a talented craftsman so I was guaranteed to have a productive session and to learn some new things in the process. But here is what made this session awesome: Dave made me feel great about every good comment I made and he never made me feel stupid when I was wrong or didn't know (ie. when my ignorance was obvious). I was getting constant positive reinforcement. And when you're just starting to learn and you have this mountain of knowledge in front of you, it's exactly what you need. It helps you feel that, with time and practice, you may just be able to get to the top of that mountain.

Thanks Dave!
