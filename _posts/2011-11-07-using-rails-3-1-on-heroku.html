I’m now starting week 6 of Code Academy, almost halfway through, and have a lot to write about. I decided to write smaller blog posts more frequently. I also feel like I can write more interesting stuff now that I’m applying what I’m learning at Code Academy to my project, BeeBuzz.
<br/>
Today I’m going to walk you through the steps to deploying a Rails 3.1 app on Heroku. I switched to 3.1 for my project to take advantage of the assets pipeline. (Heroku’s guide on getting started with 3.1). This assumes that you have Heroku’s gem installed and a Rails 3.1 app to deploy.
<br/>
The first thing I did was edit my gemfile in Textmate and changed the line:

<pre>gem 'sqlite3'</pre>

to:

<pre>group :development do
gem 'sqlite3'
end</pre>

and added:

<pre>group :production do
gem 'pg'
end</pre>

to use postgresql, as recommended by Heroku. I have not yet switched to postgresql on my machine, so doing this allows me to continue to work with sqlite3 locally for now.

After that I ran bundle install in my terminal:

<pre>$ bundle install</pre>

I then added the changes to my git repository and pushed it to github (github being already setup, this is not the initial push):

<pre>$ git add .
$ git commit -m "init"
$ git push</pre>

Now let’s create a new branch on Heroku. To properly support Rails 3.1 Heroku recommends creating a cedar stack. By default (as of October 2011) Heroku will create a bamboo stack when you create a new branch. To get a cedar stack, use this line in your terminal:

<pre>$ heroku create --stack cedar</pre>

I usualy rename my app at this point with:

<pre>$ heroku rename newname</pre>

Now all I have to do is push my app to Heroku with:

<pre>$ git push heroku master</pre>

And I now have a Rails 3.1 deployed on Heroku to take advantage of the neat features of 3.1!
<br/>
I’m still learning so let me know in the comments what you think or if there’s anything here that I can do better. Thanks!
