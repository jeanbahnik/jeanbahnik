Week 6 at Code Academy: they’ve just released the new website in preparation for the new class in January. It looks great, go check it ou at <a href="http://codeacademy.org/">http://codeacademy.org</a>.
They added a new design program to their portfolio! In addition to the awesome program to learn to code (Ruby on Rials, HTML5 and CSS), they have partnered with Carolyn Chandler and Jim Jacoby of Manifest Digital to make a 12-week design program.
