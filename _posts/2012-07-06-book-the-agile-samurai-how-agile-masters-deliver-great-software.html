Goes through all the main agile concepts: user stories, velocity and points, spikes and epics, planning poker (our weekly estimation meetings)

meeting with customers

i like talking about risks at the beginning, and the cost of delaying those discussions

very focused on using agile with client. and while client can be internal, it still feels very contractor-focused, at least for the first half of the book

could have been much shorter, something in-between pivotal tracker's how to get started and this book.

i do like how it's trying to give you tips on how to deal with customers and setting proper expectations. it's actually helping me
