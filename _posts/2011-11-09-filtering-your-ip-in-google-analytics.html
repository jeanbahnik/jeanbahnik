Here is how to quickly filter out our IP from your Google Analytics results. I’m using the new version of Google Analytics.
<br/>
1. Go to <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/">http://www.whatismyip.com</a> to find out your IP.
<br/>
You can do that from all the places you surf the web from (home, office, your grandmother’s…). Note that it will not give you your computer’s IP but your location’s IP. In my case, it’ll exclude everyone who comes to my site from the entire office. Now that you have the IP that you want to exclude:
<br/>
2. Go to the dashboard of the account you want to edit.
<br/>
3. Click on the gears icon on the right side of the page.
<br/>
4. Under profiles, click on filters
<br/>
5. Click on + New Filter.
<br/>
6. Give it a name, select “traffic from the IP addresses” and enter the IP.
<br/>
7. Click Save
<br/>
Done!
