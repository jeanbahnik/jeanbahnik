While developing Sinatra applications, to reload changed files I've been stopping the server (<em>Ctrl C</em>) and restarting it (<em>Rackup</em>), wasting precious time with every change. Today I finally went ahead and added the Reloader extension. Here is how:

Install the gem on your machine (I didn't add it to the Gemfile since I don't need it on production):
<pre>$ gem install sinatra-contrib</pre>
For the simple wedding website that I am working on, a classic Sinatra application, I'm simply requiring it through:
<pre>require "sinatra/reloader" if development?</pre>
For the modular application that I'm building at work, I added the following code to require it:
<pre>require "sinatra/reloader"

class MyApp &lt; Sinatra::Base
  configure :development do
    register Sinatra::Reloader
  end
end</pre>
That's it! Either application will now reload the changed files with every incoming request. If you need to restart the HTTP server on every request check out <a href="http://rtomayko.github.com/shotgun/">shotgun</a>.
