### Custom iOS App

Another iOS app we were able to take from product vision & design all the way through first release was an iPad app created to standardize and better the experience for the custom garment process. This app and the backend service that supported it provided the first real structured data set related to our custom garment business. The app gave employees the ability to store and edit member measurements and create / edit / duplicate orders. Beyond this it provided several auto-calculated and auto-completed values, as well as warnings when values are outside of an expected threshold.
