Today I'm publishing the landing page for my first book/course project: [Tech debt is like...]({% post_url 2020-09-07-tech-debt-is-like-book %}), a book to help engineers get their point across effectively, convince stakeholders of their ideas, and finally get the business to agree to invest in that tech debt work or architecture project their team needs to tackle.

This is the first time I'm working on a project in public. I'll be following @adamwathan's [recipe](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/) that he borrowed from Authority from @nathanbarry. The thing that pushed me to start (after years of wanting to) was Adam's friend's idea of a tripwire product, something small to get some experience launching something and make a bigger project feel a lot more doable.

To stick to it, I scheduled daily writing to-dos, weekly interview goals, and regular email updates, to avoid spending time planning instead of executing.

I'll consider it a success if I complete it, learn from it, and a big success if I make $10,000 in sales.

Send me your email address and I'll let you know when it's ready!
