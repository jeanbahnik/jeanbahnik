*First, say hello* is a short book of analogies and stories from engineers that I'm writing to help you work with non-engineers. Learn from engineers and engineering leaders how to get your point across, how to convince stakeholders of your ideas. And finally get the business to agree to invest in that tech debt work or that architecture project you and your team need to tckle. Through analogies and stories of peers, you will learn to communicate the challenges of software development with the business, to deliver projects through better collaboration, and to build long-lasting relationships that will help your career.

* **Get buy-in** for your ideas
* Improve your **collaboration skills**
* Help your team **deliver impactful projects**
* Increase your **team's morale**
* Be a **successful advocate for best engineers practices**
* **Build long-lasting relationships** with PMs, designers and other stakeholders
