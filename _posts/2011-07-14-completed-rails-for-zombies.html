I just finished the Rails for Zombies tutorial at, yes… <a href="http://railsforzombies.com/">http://railsforzombies.com/</a>. It was recommended on the rails website (<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts">http://rubyonrails.org/screencasts</a>) and so after a quick intro on tryruby.org I signed up for Code School and the free Rails for Zombie tutorial. Remember, at this point, I wouldn’t even consider myself a beginner. More like someone who once knew how to program and who really wants to learn again.

Well after a couple of hours going through the 5 lessons of Rails for Zombie I feel like I’m starting to get a better idea of the language. But I need a more holistic approach. I’m very excited about <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a> by Michael Hartl (<a href="http://twitter.com/mhartl">@mhartl</a>). I’m also getting the physical book version (from Amazon).
