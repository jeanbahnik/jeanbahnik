This is not one of those "How I made $1,000,000 writing a book in 3 days" article. It's not an how-to at all. This is what I learned writing the first draft of a fiction after years of wanting to do this. Because I think the revealing exercise would be immensely valuable to anyone wanting to write a book. So yeah, the advice is as simple as "just do it", but not for the reasons you think. Just do it because you will learn a lot about your journey after trying. Here are my findings.

My first book project is a children's book, a science fiction story about a boy who wakes up in a hotel in Paris not knowing where his family is. tells the story of a kid thrown into a war with an invading species while on vacation in Paris.

The good  
It's so much fun. At least on days when I felt like it. There's something very gratifying about writing down the thoughts that are going through your mind. I followed Stephen King's advice to not have a full story in mind but to let the story unfold by itself. And it was awesome.  
Length mattered less that I thought but was still as unpredictable as I had expected. I aimed for forty-four thousand words. I finished the first draft just shy of twenty thousand. That goal was very arbitrary. It was what I estimated a nine-to-eleven year old could read, plus ten percent that would be edited out. I'm not at all concerned about coming up short. My draft has a lot of areas that will require more writing. More on that below.  
I managed to consistently write every day. Some days I gave myself a break and only wrote a hundred words or so. I did start with a non-ambitious goal. Five hundred words is doable in less than an hour. That was on purpose and I'm glad I did.  
That feeling when I had written something good before going to work. Which means getting my running in, getting ready and breakfast AND writing before the day feels like it has started. And the bonus comes at the end of the work, when I don't have to write because that's already done, and I can devote time to learning or reading or relaxing.  

The bad  
So many plot holes. There's a story, characters with a little depth that do things and an ending. But overall it feels more like the structure of a house than an almost complete house that just needs paint and finishing touches. That's ok. Maybe my method will be more iterative than a first draft that needs edits. I'm sure giving myself the necessary time to do the writing every day, as opposed to some days just trying to get it done, would also help  
Some days, I feel like I was so far from writing my best. It was just about getting it done before going to work.  
Staying honest can be challenging at times. I started reading Zola's The Belly of Paris with its incredible descriptions and use of vocabulary and forgot who I was writing for.  
I have no idea if my readers will care about my style, what I choose to write, my rhythm, etc: getting no feedback is frustrating. As a software developer who lives for iterations, for small features that are A/B tested, for quick feedback, this is painful. I feel like I'm flying blind. Remember that last project that took way too long and ultimately failed to deliver any business value, and you wished you had tested your assumptions with a much smaller MVP and saved yourself a lot of pain and embarrassment. Yeah, that's what I am worried about right now. Except I only spend forty days on it. Still, you get it, it's uncomfortable.

What's next  
I'm taking six weeks off from that book, as recommended by Stephen King. I'm off to a bad start when it comes to not thinking about the book, I already have a completely new idea on who my villains should be, their back story, that I'm excited to research and include in the book. But I'm confident that starting to write something else will get my mind off of the book soon. Then it'll be time for the second draft.
  
Overall, I'm enjoying the journey and what I'm finding out about myself and what it takes to try and write a book. I am curious to go through the next exercise, the edit that will be more of a rewrite. Just like I can't wait to get some feedback, no matter what the feedback is.
