I just finished implementing the excellent guide by Steve Richert (<a href="http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2011/05/31/user-centric-routing-in-rails-3/">http://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2011/05/31/user-centric-routing-in-rails-3/</a>) to change the home page route based on whether the user is logged in or not. The last comment on the thread gave me the solution for using with sessions instead of cookies:
{% highlight ruby %}
request.session[:your_key]
{% endhighlight %}
instead of
{% highlight ruby %}
request.cookies.key?("user_token")
{% endhighlight %}
I need to implement cookies next and make logins rememberable. Pretty excited about this first little programming task of the year.
