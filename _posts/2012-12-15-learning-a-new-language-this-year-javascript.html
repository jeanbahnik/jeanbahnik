Over the next few weeks, some people on the team at Trunk Club are going to be working with Ember.js and Backbone, and maybe some other libraries and frameworks. The goal is to choose one that will, among other things, help us build faster applications. I’m simplifying here, but the basic idea is to improve user experience through speed.
<br/><br/>
We use coffeescript, I've dabbled with jQuery and paired with people on Backbone but I am frustrated with not understanding enough, with not knowing the foundations. So <strong>I've decided that I would seriously learn javascript</strong>, starting right now!
<br/><br/>
I'm excited because this is the second language that I learn after Ruby. I'm hoping that it will be an interesting challenge, that it will benefit my work and my personal projects, and that it will feel easier after having spent the last year learning programming.
<br/><br/>
Here is my three-pronged approach: screencasts and exercises (<a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> and <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>) and books (I started with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Introduction-Programming-ebook/dp/B004OEJNQ0/">Eloquent Javascript</a>). I will update my blog as I find more books and exercises, online help and reference, and when I pick a project to use my new skills.

<strong>Quick update:</strong> since drafting this post: so far it feels much easier than learning a first language. It's also nice how Codecademy and Eloquent Ruby seem to follow the exact same curriculum (at least it feels like what you learn in one is reinforced by reading it again or by practicing it on the other).
