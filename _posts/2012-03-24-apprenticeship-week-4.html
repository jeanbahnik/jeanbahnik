This week I've been very busy gathering requirements for the dashboards project that I am working on. We have a ton of data available and the goal is to share as much of it as possible to help people throughout the organization make informed decisions. A lot of it revolves around sales activity but we also have important data for the fulfillment team, the product team and the finance team. So a lot of my time this week was spent meeting with people from all departments, learning about their data needs, but also where the data resides, what kind of metrics they currently get and how they work with it (SQL, EXCEL, etc…). The list of requirements got very long by the end of the week so we narrowed it down to a short list of KPIs that would have the biggest impact on the company.

In other news, a new Sr. Engineer, Corey Ehmke, joined the team. I was able to meet with him during his interview process and he liked the idea of having an apprenticeship, pairing, learning and teaching. He brings a lot of testing, machine learning and MongoDB knowledge. Sounds promising.

I also got to meet and chat a little bit with David Chelimsky, lead developer of RSpec and co-author of the book on it at a Whisky tasting event. Whisky was good, David was very nice, should do tasting more often.

Next week: evaluating data visualization tools and starting to work on the SQL queries for the dashboards.
