You can use a layout for your emails just like the layout file for your website. I just implemented it to keep the look of <a href="http://utellmewhen.com">utellmewhen</a>'s emails clean and consistant.

Here is the link to the Ruby Guide on it: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-layouts">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-layouts</a>.

I first created my email in html, sticking with tables to format the email over divs. I included the css styling into the elements, not in a header.

Then I saved the file as user_mailer.html.erb in the views/layouts folder. I initially saved it in my views/user_mailer by mistake. Make sure you put the layout... in the layouts folder.

Then I put &lt;%= yield %&gt; in my layout file and that was it.

You can also override the layout that you use with:
<pre>class UserMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base
  layout 'awesome' # use awesome.(html|text).erb as the layout
end</pre>
Hope this helps.
