You can use a layout for your emails just like the layout file for your website. I just implemented it to keep the look of the <a href="https://github.com/jeanbahnik/utellemewhen">utellmewhen app</a>'s emails clean and consistant.
<br/><br/>
Here is the link to the Ruby Guide on it: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-layouts">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-layouts</a>.
<br/><br/>
I first created my email in html, sticking with tables to format the email over divs. I included the css styling into the elements, not in a header.
<br/><br/>
Then I saved the file as user_mailer.html.erb in the views/layouts folder. I initially saved it in my views/user_mailer by mistake. Make sure you put the layout... in the layouts folder.
<br/><br/>
Then I put {% highlight ruby %}<%= yield %>{% endhighlight %} in my layout file and that was it.
<br/><br/>
You can also override the layout that you use with:
{% highlight ruby %}
class UserMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  layout 'awesome' # use awesome.(html|text).erb as the layout
end
{% endhighlight %}
Hope this helps.
