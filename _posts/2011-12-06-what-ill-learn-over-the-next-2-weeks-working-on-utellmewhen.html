I just sent all of Code Academy's mentors a list of features that I would like to work on over the next two weeks. I figured it'd help them identify the ones that they could help with but the main reason I'm putting this list out there (and on this blog) is to put myself "against the wall" and hold myself accountable.
<br/><br/>
So here it is:
<ul>
	<li>Implement the Devise gem or the Sorcery gem for user authentication;</li>
	<li>Implement the OmniAuth gem for Twitter/Facebook/Google login and registration;</li>
	<li>Create a widget for race organizers to put on their site;</li>
	<li>Implement a basic responsive design to improve the UX on small screens;</li>
	<li>Create a section where people can answer questions about race dates;</li>
	<li>Allow users to easily share their questions (basic social sharing and/or public profiles);</li>
	<li>Learn how to better use Pivotal Tracker;</li>
	<li>Learn about Heroku add-ons that can improve the site's performance and/or look into using a tool like New Relic.</li>
</ul>
These features and tasks should be the subjects of my next blog posts.
