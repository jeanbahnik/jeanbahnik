I just started reading the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl yesterday and already I’m wondering which software to use to edit code.

A friend of mine recommended Coda, which I really like. But Hartl recommends Textmate. The official rails website recommends Textmate. And there’s also a lot of love in the community for vim, mvim on mac.

Hartl is right when he says in a note about tools: “In the process of getting your development environment up and running, you may find that you spend a lot of time getting everything just right. The learning process for editors and IDEs is particularly long; you can spend weeks on TextMate or Vim tutorials alone. If you’re new to this game, I want to assure you that spending time learning tools is normal. Everyone goes through it. Sometimes it is frustrating, and it’s easy to get impatient when you have an awesome web app in your head and you just want to learn Rails already, but have to spend a week learning some weird ancient Unix editor just to get started. But a craftsman has to know his tools; in the end the reward is worth the effort.” I couldn’t agree more.

So for now I decided to go with Coda for now. It’s something that I’ve already used before and it’ll save some money (Textmate is $57). But I may switch to another tool later based on what I learn from Hartl’s book or based on what I hear in the Rails community. It’s probably an eternal debate, but what tools do you use and why would you recommend it over the others?
