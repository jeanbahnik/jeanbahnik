October 2nd 2011 was my last day at work. I had been with the company for more than four years. The first couple of years were great: breaking records, building a strong team, improving the product, learning finance and how to manage a sales team. But things were changing rapidly. In my opinion, our fast growth was hurting the morale and the culture of the company. I was disagreeing more and more with the way we were doing things, especially on the technology side. As disappointed as I was to lose my job, I also felt a huge sense of relief that day.
<br/>
I was very lucky to stumble upon Code Academy when I did. It came at the perfect time for me. I was told that my position was being canceled the day before my interview for Code Academy. And I started Code Academy the day after my last day at work.
<br/>
And for the next twelve weeks
<br/>
Upon my return form my holiday trip with my family I started my job search. I did send a few resumes for marketing position because I was afraid that I couldn't get a job as a junior developer. But I focused all my energy into getting a position as a junior developer in a great company.
<br/>
Finally at the end of February, I started as an apprentice engineer at <a href="http://trunkclub.com">Trunk Club</a>. And it's been an amazing experience. Trunk Club is a men's apparel store with a twist: we start with an assortment of the best brands in men’s fashion, and then personally hand select a “trunk” of clothes for you based on your preferences.
<br/>
The first week here I pushed my first code change. And since then I've been learning something new every day. I'm surrounded by great people who help me a lot, both here at Trunk Club but also in the Chicago tech community. Learning, growing as a developer, expanding my skills and hopefully return the favor by teaching someone some day. I still have a long way to go

Thank you
