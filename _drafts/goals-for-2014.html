Here it is, personal goals for this year:

It's a bit more aggressive than last year's goal (<a href="/2012/12/15/learning-a-new-language-this-year-javascript.html">Learning a new language this year: javascript</a>)

An iPhone app:
I started learning Objective-C in December, and my goal is to publish an app to the app store this year.

Building up on a simple API app to support my iPhone app, port them to:
Learn Go
Learn Python
(Learn Clojure)

Set up and release to EC2, Heroku
Using Heroku for now, migrate to EC2/RDS

Maybe: Memcached, MySQL, Cassandra, App Engine, Messaging

Port pick_pack app to Brunch with Panache

Build an app with Middleman. Learned to use Jekyll last eyar for this blog, read some interesting selling points about middleman

Build an app with Angular

Keep me accountable, ask me how I'm doing. I'll update this blog post with progress.
