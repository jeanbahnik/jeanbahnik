## *"Regardless of timeline, what would you like to do next?"*

This is a question that I try to get the people on my team to answer during our one-on-ones. I say try because it's not an easy question to answer for most people.

I truly believe that to keep people you have to acknowledge that no-one is a lifer, that everyone has aspirations, and that everyone wants to do something else at some point. But that where you come in and make them want to stay: by helping them grow the skills that they will need to get that next position.

For one, that position, or aspiration may not be attainable at your company. Unless you're an incubator or a VC, there's no "start my own company" job available. They may also want to move geography, or industry. Or try something completely new like go from engineering to product management and I may not be able to provide such an opportunity. But we may as well help them grow the skills needed to get there.

It's often very hard for people to answer that question. Not that they're afraid of negative consequences. I think it's easy to ask in a non-scarry way (*"Regardless of timeline..."*). It's just that most of the time people have not thought about it, they did not take the time to think about their career in terms of progression

It's important in the engineering world because there are some very distinct paths available: engineers can go down an architect path, a managerial path, a product path. They can start their own business, or join a series-A, an established big firm. They can go into freelancing, consulting or join a product company. And geo-wise, they can easily work anywhere in the world.

First step is get them to answer that question
