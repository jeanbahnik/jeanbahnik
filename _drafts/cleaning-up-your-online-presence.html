We've been interviewing a lot of people at TC.
It makes me wonder how I would do, starting with my online presence.
I searched for my name using google chrome's Incognito tab feature
A lot of services that I signed up for and am not using
I think it's better not to have a service than to look like you're not using it.
I started closing down my accounts, using the awesome http://justdelete.me/
It's also about making an effort to stay active on the apps that I choose to keep, like my blog and 500px, G+
After a few weeks, all of the deleted accounts went from 404 error pages to being removed from google's search results.
