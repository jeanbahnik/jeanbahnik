If I knew that I had to build an app for scale, I would... (SOA, messaging, CI, logs, hosting...)
But I don't have one million users or $MM, and I want to learn, and relive the past 2 years at TC so I'm going to make my life complicated.
Rails 4, mysql, ruby 2, haml
Heroku, switch to pg

Switch to:
SOA
Backbone or Chaplin
Bootstrap
Digital Ocean hosting
Thin/Puma/Unicorn
Rails -> Sinatra/Grape
AWS
Messaging
Mongo
Stripe/Braintree/Balanced
