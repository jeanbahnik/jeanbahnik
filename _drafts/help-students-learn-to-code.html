It's been two years since I started working as a software engineer this month. It's been an awesome journey, full of stumbles and small and big victories. To celebrate two years of learning, I am launching a Teespring campaign and will donate all the proceeds to <a href="http://code.org/">code.org</a>. You can help by getting your own awesome t-shirt at <a href="http://teespring.com/teachtocode">teespring.com/teachtocode</a>
